.XX
tpburst - uses numerical integration to find exact transition
.PP
probabilities for any standard burst mode type circuit.
A burst mode circuit is one in which inputs and
outputs are constrained to occure in burst.  This means that a
group of input signals transition, then a group of output signals
transition, etc.  With this method it is not possible for signals
to become enabled during a burst.  This means that there are well
defined source and sync nodes in any state graph.  With this
restriction, exact transition probabilies are calculated by 
evaluating traces between source and sync nodes in the state graph.
Before this command can be run a valid reduced state graph must
exist.  The results of this command are stored to the state table
in the form of transition probabilities.  The accuracy of the
becomes heuristic with non-burst-mode specifications.
