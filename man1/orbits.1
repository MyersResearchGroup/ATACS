orbits
.PP
This function is used to select whether state graphs are found
using Orbits (DEFAULT=NOT).  If Orbits is used then ATACS
generates a specification for Orbits, executes Orbits to
produce a state graph in grf format which is read into
ATACS and stored to the appropriate file in ATACS state
graph format.
