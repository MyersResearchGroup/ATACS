.PP
This command is used to eliminate dummy transitions from the reduced state
graph.  When two states are separated by a dummy transition, they have the
same state code (though perhaps different enablings).  They can be merged
if this combination does not introduce new behaviors.  This routines merges
as many such state pairs as possible.  It then does a complete state coding
(CSC) check to see whether the state graph is directly implementable as
a circuit.
