.XX
dtmcrp - reduced power analysis the loaded ER
.PP
This command assumes that the state table representing
the specification can be modeled as a Discrete Time Markov Chain
(dtmc) and analysis that chain to find its steady state probabilty
distribution.  The command first extracts and builds from the
state table, the transition matrix.  Transition probabilities can
be obtained using any of the standard tp* commands (see help).
With the transition matrix, the long term probabilities are found
using the reduced power method.  The results are stored back into
the state table and control is returned to the caller.  Before
this command can be run, it is necessary to have a state table
containing transition probabilities.
