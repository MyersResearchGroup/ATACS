findwctd <filename>
.PP
This function finds all the possible estimates of the
worst-case time differences using the number of cycles given,
and it outputs the results to a file named <filename>.wctd
in the following form:
.PP
t(< v,i >) - t(< u,i-j >) = [ L,U ]
.PP
If the bound is not exact then the following is printed:
.PP
t(< v,i >) - t(< u,i-j >) = [ L',U' ] : Best case = [ Lbest,Ubest ]
