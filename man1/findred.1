findred <filename>
.PP
This function finds all the redundant rules in the current
structure, and it outputs the results to the file named
<filename>.rr which is in the following form:
.PP
<enabling event> <enabled event> <epsilon> <lower bound> <upper bound>
.PP
If a rule has the following annotation after it: Lbest = <Value of Lbest>
then has not been declared redundant, but it may be if more
cycles are analyzed.  If any ordering rule is not found to be
redundant than an exception is raised and the non-redundant
ordering rules are stored to the file named <filename>.err.
