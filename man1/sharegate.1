This command turns on the gate sharing option for gatelevel synthesis.
The basic gatelevel synthesis algorithm requires that each excitation 
region be implemented by a single disjoint cover.  If this switch is
on, it allows covers to intersect other excitation regions as long as
they completely contain it.  In other words, one cover may implement
multiple excitation regions as long as it does so completely.  It is
greedy, so it may cause synthesis to fail.  For example, assume you
have three excitation regions (1,2, and 3).  One cover implements 1 and 2
and the other implements 2 and 3.  These two covers are not disjoint so
they are not gatelevel hazard-free.
