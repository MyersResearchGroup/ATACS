ctmc - continuous time markovian analysis
.PP
This approximates probability density functions for events";
as negative exponentials with rates equal to the expected value of
the events' original probability density functions.  Using the
negative exponential, a rate transition matrix is derived for
the CTMC representing the system as a stochastic process.  The EMC
of the CTMC is derived and the resulting transition matrix is
stored as the transition probabilities in the state graph and the
steady state transition probablities are found using the reduced
power method. From the steady state distribution of the EMC, the
long-term distribution for the CTMC is found according to:
.br
                   zQ = 0,
.br
where z is the steady state vector and Q is the transition rate
matrix.  This represents the distribution of probability on states
when the rate of change of the system is zero.  State graph
required for this command.  Results are saved in state table.
