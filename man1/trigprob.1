trigprob - calculates triggers probabilities
.PP
This calculates the probability of any signal in the system
being the trigger signal on a gate.  Before running this 
command a reduced state graph must exist with transition 
probabilties and long term probabilities. (e.g., findrsg 
followed by one of the following commands: tpsim, makovlin, 
or simtel).
