sis
.PP
This function is used to select whether synthesis is performed
by SIS or not (DEFAULT=NOT).  If SIS is being used then ATACS
will switch to speed-independent mode, verify that there is no
CSC violations then produce a graph file named <filename>.g
and a SIS script file named <filename>.scr.  The results from
synthesis by SIS are stored in a file named <filename>.sis
which is read into ATACS to get area and delay numbers.
