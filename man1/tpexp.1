tpexp - exponential approximation
.PP
tpexp approximates probability density functions for events
as negative exponentials with rates equal to the expected value of
the events' original probability density functions.  Using the
negative exponential, a rate transition matrix is derived for
the CTMC representing the system as a stochastic process.  The EMC
of the CTMC is derived and the resulting transition matrix is
stored as the transition probabilities in the state graph.
A valid state graph must exist to run this command.  Any
transition probabilities already stored in the state table will be
replaced with the results of this command.
