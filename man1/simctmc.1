.XX
simctmc - stochastic simulation to track time in markings
.PP
This performs a stochastic simulation on the currently
loaded TEL structure where the simulation tracks the total
simulated time as well as the total time spent in each state of
the system.  The simulation stops when the probability of being
in a state at any time t converges to a value withing the
system's tolerance setting (see tolerance).  The probabilities
from the simulation are stored into the state table.  NOTE: This
command does not generate transition probabilities, only state
state probabilities.  This cannot be run without first finding
a valid state graph.
