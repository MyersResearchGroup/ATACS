burst
.PP
This command selects generalized C-elements as the target technology
which are used under a burst-mode assumption.  With this selection, a 
covering constraint and an modified entrance constraint must be 
satisfied.  The modified entrance constraint only results in extra
logic when a hazard can occur before the circuit is given a chance
to stabilize.
