tprglin - transition probabilities in a region graph
.PP
This uses a region graph to calculate transition
probabilities in a design.  This method is very heuristic in that
it naively squashes all complex regions into small linear regins.
This implies that the algorithm ignores the time at which the
region was entered and just assumes that it was entered at its
minimum timer values for all of the signals enabled in the region.
A valid region graph must exist before this command can be run.
If a state table is not a region graph, this command will cause an
assertion failure (sorry chris).
The results of this command are stored to the state table
in the form of transition probabilities.
