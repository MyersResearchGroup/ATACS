tpsim - stochastic simulation for transition probabilities
.PP
This uses stochastic simulation to find transition
probabilities for any standard circuit.  The accuracy or
tolerance of variation allowed before the simulation will end
is controled by the tolerance system setting (tolerance or -T).
Necessary to run this command is any type of valid state table.
The results of this command are stored to the state table
in the form of transition probabilities.
