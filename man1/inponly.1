inponly
.PP
This command determines which signals are allowed to be used as context
signals when solving the context signal tables.  When it is selected,
only inputs are allowed as context signals.  When it is not selected,
both inputs and outputs are allowed as context signals.  The default
is that both inputs and outputs are allowed.  This command is used in
conjunction with the burst command to match 3D's results for synthesis
which only allows inputs to be used in the logic.
