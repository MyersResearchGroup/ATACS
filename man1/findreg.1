findreg <filename>
.PP
This function finds the enabled state and trigger signals
for each region associated with each signal.  The result is
stored to the file named <filename>.reg which is in the
following form:
.PP
REGIONS:
.br
STATEVECTOR:INP signal INP signal ... signal signal ...
.br
EVENT : ENABLED STATE: TRIGGER SIGNALS
.br
<event> : <enabled state> : <trigger signals>
.PP
Each state bit in an enabled state is coded as follows:
.br
0 - stable low in all states in which <event> is enabled.
.br
1 - stable high in all states in which <event> is enabled.
.br
X - can change concurrently with <event>.
.PP
Each bit in the trigger signals field is coded as follows:
.br
0 - inverse of the signal is a trigger signal.
.br
1 - signal is a trigger signal.
.br
Z - neither signal or inverse is a trigger signal.
.PP
This function also checks if any trigger signal is
non-persistent.  A trigger signal is non-persistent if it has
value X in the enabled state.  If persistence violations
are found, then an exception is raised and the non-persistent
trigger signals are stored to the file named <filename>.err.
