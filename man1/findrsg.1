findrsg <filename>
.PP
This function finds the reduced state graph, and it stores it
to the file named <filename>.rsg using the following format:
.PP
SG:
.br
STATEVECTOR:INP signal INP signal ... signal signal ...
.br
STATES:
.br
<state>
.PP
Each state bit in a state is coded as follows:
.br
0 - stable low
.br
R - currently low, but it is enabled to rise
.br
1 - stable high
.br
F - currently high, but it is enabled to fall
.PP
If the graph could be potentially reduced further with more
cycles, a warning is printed.  The reduced state graph is also
checked if it satisfies complete state coding (CSC) property.
A CSC violation occurs if two states have the same state code,
but different output signals are enabled.  If there are CSC
violations, an exception is raised and each pair of states
causing a violation is stored to the file <filename>.err.
