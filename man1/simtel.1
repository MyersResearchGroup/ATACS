.XX
simtel - stochastic simulation of the TEL
.PP
Command to find the steady-state probability distribution
by performing a stochastic timing simulation on the currently
state graph and TEL structure.  The accuracy of the simulation is
controlled by the Tolerance system setting ( see tolerance ).
The simulation will run until the change in values between several
successive simulation cycles is within in the specified tolerance
setting.  The results of the simulation are stored into the state
table and can be output with the showstat command.
