findcover <filename>
.PP
This function finds the optimal cover to resolve all conflicts
using the minimum number of context rules.  The resulting list
of context rules are stored to the file named <filename>.cr
which is in the following form:
.PP
<enabling event> <enabled event> <epsilon> <lower bound> <upper bound>
.PP
If the procedure is unable to find context rules to solve all
conflicts, it will raise an exception and list the remaining
problems in the file <filename>.err in the form:
.PP
Context Rule Table for <event>
.br
<problem state> : list of enabling events for context rules
