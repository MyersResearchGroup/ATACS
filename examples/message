Tip:  This might mean you have not checked in all the files you have
modified.  Consider running the shell command

        cvs commit

(with NO file name) to commit all the files you have modified.  You
will be prompted for one log message for all the files.  It is best to
run this as soon as you have fixed a given bug or implemented a given
feature.

If you need to check in a group of files but not all the files you
have modified, you can use the shell command

        cvs commit <file1> <file2>...
