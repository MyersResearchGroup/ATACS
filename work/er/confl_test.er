## This is a celement with conflict added between a and b (i.e., a+ # b+ and
## a- # b- ).  The purpose of this example is to create a simple test of
## the time independent choice conflict semantics.  The semantics basically
## states that when 2 enabled events conflict (i.e., the events have enough
## rules marked or fired to allow them fire if timing were ignored), the 
## choice is resolved independent of time.
